\section{Introduction}
\label{int}

The {\em $\star$-product} $ \ph \star \ps $
of test functions $ \ph $ and $ \ps $ on the euclidean plane
\begin{align}
    ( \ph \star \ps )(x,y)
    &:=
    \int \ph(x,z)\ps(z,y) \intd{z}
    &&\text{for all $ x,y \in \nrR $,}
\end{align}
can be seen as a generalization of matrix multiplication \cite{RBG025}.
For example, it can be used to describe the composition of the kernels
of two continuous linear operators $ L_\ph $ and $ L_\ps $
mapping from $ \fsDis( \nrR ) $ to $ \fsTest( \nrR ) $ via
\begin{align}
    L_\ph \colon T \Mto ( y \mto \ska{T}{\ph(\cdot,y)} ),
\end{align}
according to Schwarz' kernel theorem.

For distributions $ T $ and $ S $ on $ \nrR^2 $
it is more complicated to define $ T \star S $
and to identify suitable existence criteria.
In this note we transport the definition
of convolution of distributions to the $\star$-product
and show same applied example where it appears
and compare it to the definition investigated recently \cite{RBG025}.

In this note we discuss the $ \star $-product between distributions
from the space $ \fsSmobnd(\nrR^n) \teproDi \fsDis(\nrR^n) $,
which can be understood as the distributions
that are smooth in the diagonal direction but can have
arbitrary regularity on the codiagonal direction.
This allows to embedded multiplication of uniformly bounded smooth functions
and convolution of distributions in the sense of Section~3 in \cite[p.\,370]{ort004}.
